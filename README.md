# Handwritten-solver
This Supervised model uses a small part of Original MNIST dataset 
that had 60,000 training samples, and 10,000 test samples.
Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each having
a grayscale value of 0 - 255

here it uses a simplified version of training the model upon 0-9,+,-,*,/
only to fetch the answer of basic handwritten equation.
This idea has possibility of wide variety of features that could be added to it and deployed 

If you fork/copy this code. please do send me what improvements did you make to the code 
as that would make me very happy.
## How to run:
1. Downoad the dataset and extract the necessary files
Link to download the dataset:

2. Train the CNN and SAVE THE MODEL
3. Run the Equation notebook to obtain the output

(Runs better with GPU timings)
